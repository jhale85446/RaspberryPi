# RaspberryPi

This repository contains notes and source code for Raspberry Pi projects. Most of these projects will either be hacking/security related or test programs relating to Pi GPIO functions for future use.

The notes included will generally have links to the source. Some may be quick references for future use and others may be improvements on scripts or methods found elsewhere.

Hopefully if you have found this repo it can be of some use to you.
